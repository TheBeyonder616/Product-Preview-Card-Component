## My Process

I approached this project by focusing on creating a visually appealing and responsive product preview card component using modern web design techniques.

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties for theming
- Flexbox for layout management
- Responsive design using `clamp()` and viewport-relative units (vw)
- Google Fonts - "Fraunces" and "Montserrat" for typography

### What I Learned

This project reinforced my knowledge in:

- **Responsive Design:** Leveraging `clamp()` for fluid and adaptable font sizes and spacing.
- **CSS Variables:** Utilizing custom properties for consistent theming and easier maintenance.
- **Accessibility:** Ensuring the design is both responsive and accessible.

### Continued Development

Future projects will focus on:

- **CSS Grid:** For more advanced and intricate layouts.
- **JavaScript:** Integrating interactive features to enhance user experience.
- **Accessibility & SEO:** Improving practices to make sites more inclusive and search-engine friendly.
